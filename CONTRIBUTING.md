## Branches

Choosing a proper name for a branch helps us identify its purpose and possibly find an associated bug or feature.
Generally a branch name should include a topic such as `fix` or `feature` followed by a description and an issue number
if applicable. Branches should have only changes relevant to a specific issue.

```
git checkout -b fix/service-template-typo-1234
git checkout -b feature/config-handling-1235
